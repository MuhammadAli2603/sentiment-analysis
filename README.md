Sentiment Analysis with Machine Learning
This project performs sentiment analysis using a machine learning model trained on text data. It classifies text into sentiment categories such as positive, negative, or neutral.

ðŸ“Œ Features
Preprocessing of textual data (tokenization, vectorization)

Model training and evaluation (Logistic Regression)

Prediction on new/unseen text input

Data visualization using word clouds and plots
ðŸš€ How to Use
Follow the steps:

Load and preprocess the dataset

Train and evaluate the model

Run predictions on new text

ðŸ§  Model
Type: Logistic Regression (can be replaced with other models)

Input: Raw text

Output: Sentiment class label

ðŸ“Š Example
python
Copy
predict_sentiment("I love this product!")
# Output: Positive
ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements
Deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Flask

Add support for multiple models

Improve accuracy with deep learning (e.g., LSTM, BERT)
